# Student Management System - Assignment 1


## A. Project Overview
This project is a simple Student Management System written in Java. It allows tracking student information such as GPA and credits, and managing them within a specific course.

## B. Class Descriptions
* **Student**: Handles individual student data (name, ID, GPA, credits) with methods to update scores and check for honors.
* **Course**: Manages a group of students, calculates the average GPA of the class, and identifies the student with the most credits.

## C. How to Run
1. Open the terminal in the project folder.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
## D. Screenshots

## E. Reflection
In this assignment, I learned how to use object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation. The most challenging part was setting up the project structure and fixing the errors in the code. I now understand how different classes interact to store and process data in Java.
